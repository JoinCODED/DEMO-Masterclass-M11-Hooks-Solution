# Hooks

Hooks are nice, I promise.

## Steps

1. Fork and clone [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/TASK-Masterclass-M11-Hooks).
2. Install the dependencies using `npm i`.
3. Start the BE & FE servers using `npm start` (`concurrently` is set up, so you do not have to worry about anything).

## Scroll To Top Hook

1. Go to `hooks/useScrollToTop.tsx`.
2. Get the current location using the location hook from react router dom.
3. Each time the location changes, the page scrolls to top (hint: use `useEffect`).
